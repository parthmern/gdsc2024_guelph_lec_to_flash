          Ever had those late night study sessions with those unorganized notes?
          📚 Well, we have just the thing for you! Introducing SoundCard AI 🤖.
          All you have to do is leave it on and forget about it. It will
          automatically summarize lectures and generate organized notes in the
          form of flashcards 🗂️, making it easier for you to review and learn in
          the classroom ✨.
